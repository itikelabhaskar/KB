# Customer Case Study — BigCorp Manufacturing

## Company Profile

- **Company:** BigCorp Manufacturing Inc.
- **Industry:** Industrial Manufacturing
- **Employees:** 5,000+
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (headquarters), 12 factory sites across North America

## Challenge

BigCorp had critical company knowledge scattered across SharePoint sites, shared drives, email threads, and individual laptops. Engineers spent an average of **2.5 hours per day** searching for technical documentation, safety procedures, and compliance records.

Key pain points:
- Technical manuals were stored in 6 different systems with no unified search.
- Compliance documents were frequently outdated because version control was manual.
- New employees took 3-4 months to become productive due to difficulty finding information.

## Solution

BigCorp deployed TechNova's Enterprise plan across all 12 sites. Implementation took 8 weeks and included:

1. **Migration:** 45,000 documents from 6 legacy systems into TechNova's unified platform.
2. **Role-based access:** Set up department-based permissions so factory floor workers, engineers, and management each see relevant documents.
3. **AI-powered search:** Employees can now ask questions in plain English and get instant answers with citations.

## Results (After 6 Months)

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average search time per query | 12 minutes | 45 seconds | **94% reduction** |
| Time spent searching per day | 2.5 hours | 20 minutes | **87% reduction** |
| New employee onboarding time | 3-4 months | 6 weeks | **50% faster** |
| Compliance audit preparation | 3 weeks | 2 days | **90% faster** |
| Document duplication rate | 35% | 4% | **89% reduction** |
