## Competitor Comparison

### 1. TechNova vs. Confluence (Atlassian)

| | TechNova | Confluence |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **AI Search** | ✅ Semantic + keyword hybrid | ❌ Keyword only |
| **AI Answers** | ✅ Generates answers with citations | ❌ No AI answers |
| **Permission Model** | ✅ Department-based RBAC | ✅ Space-level permissions |
| **Pricing** | $79/user (Pro) | $6.05/user (Standard) |
| **Deployment** | Cloud + On-premise | Cloud only (Data Center discontinued) |

**Key selling point:** "Confluence is good for creating documents, but terrible for finding them. TechNova's AI search finds answers 10x faster."

### 2. TechNova vs. Notion

| | TechNova | Notion |
|---|----------|--------|
| **AI Search** | ✅ Hybrid RAG search | ⚠️ Basic AI (Notion AI add-on) |
| **Enterprise Security** | ✅ SOC 2, SSO, RBAC | ⚠️ Limited (Enterprise plan only) |
| **Document Import** | ✅ PDF, MD, JSON auto-indexing | ❌ Manual import only |
| **Pricing** | $79/user (Pro) | $10/user (Plus) + $8/user for AI |

**Key selling point:** "Notion is great for small teams, but lacks enterprise-grade security and AI-powered knowledge retrieval."

### 3. TechNova vs. Glean

| | TechNova | Glean |
|---|----------|-------|
| **AI Search** | ✅ Custom RAG pipeline | ✅ Enterprise AI search |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Open citations — see exact source | ❌ Black box answers |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Cloud + On-premise | ❌ Cloud only |
| **Pricing** | $79/user (Pro) | ~$15-25/user (custom) |

**Key selling point:** "Glean is a strong competitor, but TechNova gives complete transparency into where answers come from and supports on-premise deployment for regulated industries."

## Common Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already use SharePoint" | "TechNova integrates with SharePoint — we make your existing content searchable with AI." |
| "It's too expensive" | "Our customers save 2+ hours per employee per day. That's $50k+ per employee annually in recovered productivity." |
| "We don't have enough documents" | "TechNova works great with as few as 100 documents. Start small and scale." |
| "What about data security?" | "SOC 2 certified, end-to-end encryption, and on-premise option for sensitive data." |
