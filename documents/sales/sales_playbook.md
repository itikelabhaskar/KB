## Sales Process Overview

Our sales cycle typically runs **4-8 weeks** for Pro deals and **8-16 weeks** for Enterprise deals.

### Stage 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)

- Identify the prospect's current knowledge management pain points.
- Key questions to ask:
  - "How do your employees currently find internal information?"
  - "How much time per day do people spend searching for documents?"
  - "What tools do you currently use?" (Confluence, SharePoint, Notion, etc.)
  - "Have you experienced compliance issues due to outdated documents?"

### Stage 2: Demo (Week 2-3)

- Show the AI-powered search in action with the prospect's industry-specific examples.
- **Demo script:** Upload 5-10 of their actual documents (with permission) and show real-time question answering.
- Key features to highlight:
  1. Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
  2. Permission-based access control
  3. Citations in every answer
  4. Audit logging for compliance

### Stage 3: Proposal (Week 3-5)

- Send a customized proposal within 48 hours of the demo.
- Include ROI calculation based on their team size and current search time.

**ROI Formula:**
```
Annual savings = (employees × hours_saved_per_day × 250_working_days × hourly_rate) - TechNova_annual_cost
```

### Stage 4: Negotiation & Close (Week 5-8)

- Common asks: annual discount (offer 20%), extra training sessions, custom integrations.
- **Never discount more than 30%** without VP of Sales approval.
